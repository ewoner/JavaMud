<#FFFFFF>BETTERMUD 1.0 HELP
<#7F7F7F>
Welcome to BetterMUD, the second MUD for the book MUD Game Programming, by
Ron Penton. There is no central theme due to the fact that this is a learning
MUD, where you are taught to code any number of things. As such, the realm
you are entering may be bizzarre, and full of strange non-serious items,
and people too. We're here to have fun and play around, and discuss MUD
technology here.

The first thing you should do is <#FF0000>Create an account<#7f7f7f>, and then you can
<#FF0000>Create a character<#7f7f7f>, which you will use to play around with. Every account
is allowed to own two characters at the start, but you may gain the abilities
to have more than two by being a dedicated and helpful member of the community.

Please do not abuse this server, it is here for your enjoyment. Thank you,
Ron Penton.
