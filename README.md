# JavaMud
Mud code base written in Java.  Uses Java also as a scripting language to alow on the fly changes.

Uploaded the old version.  Code was orginally written in Java 5, supporting only a telenet connection.  Other types of connections were envisioned but none programmed.  Want to update to Java 8/9 and add more connections, like a Java Applet and a standalone application.
